# chalice-libcalutil -- AWS Lambda hosted helpers for libcal 

This might grow in to a home for some AWS Lambda functions that help us use libcal. Right now, there's just `update_combined_events` which publishes a combined events lists based on events from multiple calendars. 


In addition to the project dependencies in `requirements.txt`, I've been using `pylint`, `black`, and `pireqs` in my dev environment, but they're not strictly required.
